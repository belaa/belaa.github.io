    <p>I study observational cosmology at the University of California, Irvine where 
    I work on two dark energy surveys, the 
    <a a href="https://www.desi.lbl.gov" target="_blank">Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument</a> 
    and the <a href="https://lsst.slac.stanford.edu" target="_blank">Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey 
    of Space and Time</a>. Both DESI and LSST seek to understand the nature of dark energy by measuring 
    cosmic acceleration to an unprecedented level of accuracy and precision. A large part of my work is 
    dedicated to mitigating systematic effects in order to satisfy survey requirements. This includes developing 
    software pipeline infrastructure for reducing photometric redshift errors and doing integration 
    and verification testing to remove sensor effects for the LSST camera. I also work on 
    commissioning, survey validation and improving spectroscopic simulations and for DESI.</p>

    <p>Outside of work I enjoy playing and watching soccer, tending to the profusion of plants in my 
      house and my garden, ducking under waves at the beach and playing the Scottish fiddle.   </p>
